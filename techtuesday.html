<h1>Ukraine's War</h1>
    <p>
Recently a soldier from Ukraine’s 92nd Mechanized Brigade worked on the last part of a deadly supply chain that stretches from China’s factories to a basement five miles from the front lines of the war with Russia. These Ukrainian soldiers turned drones into these combat weapons. So they can make it fly further, they modified the batteries. Crazy enough, pilots would then zip tie a homemade shell to the bottom and crash the gadgets into Russian trenches and tanks, that's what turned the drones into human-guided missiles. “At night we do bombing missions, and during the day we think about how to get new drones,” said Oles Maliarevych, 44, an officer in the 92nd Mechanized Brigade. “This is a constant quest.” Ukrainians have looked at all varieties of drones and “reconstituted them to become weapons, they then had to find new ways to keep up their supplies and to continue innovating on the devices. Now Chinese suppliers have dialed back their sales, as new Chinese rules to restrict the export of drone components took effect on Sept. 1. “We’re examining every possible way to export drones from China, because whatever one may say, they produce the most there,” this is what Mr. Maliarevych said, he helps source drone supplies for his unit. 
  

Did you know that China’s biggest drone maker, has a more than 90 percent share of the global consumer drone market, according to DroneAnalyst, a research group. Chinese companies have cut back sales of drones and components to Ukrainians in recent months. On a hot morning in August, 24 Ukrainian soldiers from four units trained on a new weapon of war: a repurposed agricultural drone known as “the bat.”

NASA’s Webb Snaps Supersonic Outflow of Young Star

When stellar winds or gas jets emitted by young stars collide with neighboring gas and dust at high speeds, they create Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, which are bright regions around young stars. A Class 0 protostar, an infantile counterpart to our Sun when it was just a few tens of thousands of years old and with a mass of about 8% of the current Sun (it will eventually evolve into a star like the Sun), is shown in this view of the galaxy HH 211 taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.Because newborn stars are almost always still immersed in the gas from the molecular cloud in which they formed, infrared photography is effective for investigating these stars and their outflows. The team measured the velocities of the innermost outflow structures to be roughly 48-60 miles per second (80 to 100 kilometers per second)The difference in velocity between these sections of the outflow and the leading material they’re colliding with  the shockwave is much smaller. They saw that outflows from the youngest stars are mostly made up of molecules, because the comparatively low shock wave velocities are not energetic enough to break the molecules apart into simpler atoms and ions.

James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s premier space science observatory. In conclusion, this specific Webb is solving so many mysteries that will help look beyond planets and stars. Our technology is improving so well, NASA is able to  discover much more.

 Loro Piana is Shepherding the Future of Fashion Thanks to Blockchain Technology 

 The Loro Pina shirt our writer is holding is so soft that even though they know the fibers originate from Australia's remote Sidonia region, the yarn was spun in Verrone, Italy, and the shirt was woven in Sillavengo, Italy, they still find it hard to believe it's real. The QR code on the label and hangtag of the garment is responsible for all of the information.

 When the QR code is scanned, users are directed to the shirt's listing on the Aura Blockchain Consortium, it’s jointly controlled by a number of high-end corporations, like Mercedes-Benz, LVMH, OTB Group, Prada, and Richemont. 
 The Aura Blockchain Consortium was made in April 2021 with a dream to innovate, advancing sustainability (it aims to be carbon neutral by 2025), and providing “transparency” to its clients. There are two clear benefits of using blockchain technology in luxury markets,  without the correct QR code, scammers can find it harder to pass off counterfeit luxury goods as authentic products. If the blockchain reveals that the luxury products being sold are stolen, those who are selling them will have it hard as well.

 Because Loro Piana is one of the few premium fashion brands that is vertically integrated, using the blockchain is a logical next step in the company's technological progression. From a family of wool fabric merchants in the 19th century to the inventive business it is today, a corporation that oversees its whole production process, it has expanded in time. Nowadays, Loro Piana finds, produces, and sells its own raw materials, giving its clients a one-of-a-kind final good that has been meticulously inspected down to the fiber that goes into making it. Not all Loro Piana products have received Aura Blockchain Consortium certification as of yet.

   <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
  Mobile technology is developing quickly and allowing us to communicate immediately with anyone anywhere in the world. However, not every individual in the virtual world adheres to ethics. In reality, we have security to avoid potential crimes, but we also have cybersecurity to lower crime in the digital realm. In order to maintain confidentiality, sensitive data and systems can only be seen or read by those with appropriate authorization. For example, a group of hackers leaking credit card information. Another example of it could be when spammers cause the site to lag for other users by sending too many fake requests. The method of defending a single device from virtual threats is called cybersecurity. 

  There are many different types of threats that can attack someone's personal device. One is when a hacker sends emails that look professional and real. Normally when they send these emails, it’s so that they can get credit card numbers and more confidential information. Another type of attack is called ransomware, which is when someone blocks you out of your own account. Yes, people can really do that and you will never be able to log back in. One we find the most interesting is called Malware, this is when a software that illegally accesses your account tries to damage or destroy it. Social engineering manipulates a person to illegally access the device.   

  In conclusion, cyber security is very useful and efficient knowing that people can do much more than just hack your account now.
